"""Huawei SUN2000 + LUNA2000 driver.

This driver is deliberately *split-transport*, unlike every other brand here:

* **Telemetry is read natively** over Modbus TCP (FC03) from the inverter, so
  the control loop sees fresh battery power and SOC at its own cadence. Going
  through the ``huawei_solar`` integration's entities instead would cap the
  feedback at its hardcoded 30 s coordinator interval — far too slow for the PD
  loop, which polls every 2 s.
* **Set-points take either of two paths**, chosen per battery. By default they
  go through the ``huawei_solar`` integration's services, which own the ordering
  and safety semantics of the four-register forcible sequence. Optionally this
  driver writes that same sequence itself (FC16, same registers, same order),
  which removes the dependency for control as well as for reading.

The practical consequence differs by path. On the service path ``huawei_solar``
must stay installed and hold the battery device, and both connections coexist
behind a Modbus proxy — the add-on exists precisely to fan one Modbus slave out
to several clients. On the direct path this driver needs only its own
connection, and ``standby()`` must release over that same path: a release sent
as a service call has no device to address there, and fails silently.

Sign conventions:
  Omnibattery net power: +charge / −discharge
  Huawei 37001 charge/discharge power: +charge / −discharge  → identical, no flip.

**A forcible command is a ceiling, not a request.** The inverter produces
exactly what it was told and curtails the rest of the array: measured with a
315 W charge standing, 288 W harvested from strings that made 5054 W six seconds
after the command ended. A forcible discharge is worse — it serves the house
from the battery and leaves the MPPT tracker down entirely, and the missing
production then reads as the deficit that asks for more discharge. So while the
strings carry voltage this driver commands nothing at all and leaves the
inverter to its own regulation, which is the better controller in daylight
anyway. **A Huawei battery is under Omnibattery's control after dark only.**

Idle semantics deserve a note, and they are the opposite of what a register
battery does. ``stop_forcible_charge`` hands control back to the inverter's own
working mode, which resumes self-consumption; a *held* zero would instead be a
forcible charge at 0 W, which the hardware does accept and sustain. That held
zero was the first implementation here and it was wrong twice over: a pinned
battery cannot absorb its own PV, so the inverter derated the array, and the
control layer means something else by idle — manual mode idles once and then
leaves the device alone, which left the battery frozen. ``apply_setpoint(0)``
therefore *releases*, and so does ``standby()``.

        0.00 A — so the whole roof is lost for as long as it stands. There is
        nothing to weigh.

        **Charge is refused only where it would bind.** A forcible command is a
        ceiling on production, and a ceiling above what the array can reach is
        not a constraint at all. Measured 2 September on a cloudless morning,
        with an irradiance sensor and a separate array as controls:

        * 400 W commanded against 1839 W of harvest produced **363 W** — the
          roof cut to a fifth while irradiance held, recovering to 1936 W seven
          seconds after the release;
        * 3000 W commanded against 1936 W produced **2020 W**, tracking the sun
          as if nothing had been sent.

        So a charge at or above the harvest costs nothing — and that is the one
        charge worth having, the cheap-price slot in the middle of a lit day,
        which a symmetric gate refuses for no gain.

        The rule is self-stabilising, which is what makes it safe to compare
        against a harvest read while commanding: an allowed charge is never a
        binding cap, so the reading stays true MPP exactly while this driver is
        commanding; and a refused charge is never sent, so it cannot suppress
        the evidence that refused it. The one way out of that is the sun rising
        to meet a standing command, which :meth:`_update_pv_gate` detects by
        refusing to believe a harvest that has converged on it.

        A charge is therefore allowed only where it clears the harvest by the
        same hysteresis band that :meth:`_update_pv_gate` needs in order to
        believe the reading. Allowing one it would then disbelieve costs a
        release, a re-read, and a fresh command every ramp interval for as long
        as the harvest sits in the gap — a flip-flop out of steady sunlight,
        made of exactly the writes this inverter answers by derating the array.

        Two signals, and neither is sufficient by itself.

        commands: a forcible discharge holds the tracker down and the panels
        sit at open-circuit voltage — 374 V at 0.00 A — so voltage still reads
        daylight. What it cannot do is tell a bright morning from a dim one. An
        overcast dawn stands near 300 V while the array makes 50 W, and
        refusing to command there costs the house a discharge it needs, for
        nothing. Measured across three dawns on the reference installation,
        that band runs 45-50 minutes.

        **Harvested power says how much there is to lose**, and is the quantity
        that actually matters — but a low reading is only honest while this
        driver is released. Once a command stands, the production it suppresses
        is our own artefact, and gating on it would read a curtailed roof as
        darkness, keep commanding, and keep the roof curtailed. That is the
        failure the voltage test was introduced to stop: a discharge commanded
        at 04:32 against a dark sky, still standing at 09:22.

        A *high* reading is a different matter. Our command can only ever push
        this number down, never up, so production above the threshold is
        decisive whatever the driver is doing — that is what hands control back
        at sunrise without waiting for anything.

        A low reading while commanding is the one ambiguous case, and the only
        one that needs a probe: let go, wait for the tracker to find its own
        maximum, and read again. A probe costs seconds of curtailment. Not
        probing costs a day of it.

"""Huawei SUN2000 + LUNA2000 driver.

This driver is deliberately *split-transport*, unlike every other brand here:

* **Telemetry is read natively** over Modbus TCP (FC03) from the inverter, so
  the control loop sees fresh battery power and SOC at its own cadence. Going
  through the ``huawei_solar`` integration's entities instead would cap the
  feedback at its hardcoded 30 s coordinator interval — far too slow for the PD
  loop, which polls every 2 s.
* **Set-points take either of two paths**, chosen per battery. By default they
  go through the ``huawei_solar`` integration's services, which own the ordering
  and safety semantics of the four-register forcible sequence. Optionally this
  driver writes that same sequence itself (FC16, same registers, same order),
  which removes the dependency for control as well as for reading.

The practical consequence differs by path. On the service path ``huawei_solar``
must stay installed and hold the battery device, and both connections coexist
behind a Modbus proxy — the add-on exists precisely to fan one Modbus slave out
to several clients. On the direct path this driver needs only its own
connection, and ``standby()`` must release over that same path: a release sent
as a service call has no device to address there, and fails silently.

Sign conventions:
  Omnibattery net power: +charge / −discharge
  Huawei 37001 charge/discharge power: +charge / −discharge  → identical, no flip.

**A forcible command is a ceiling, not a request.** The inverter produces
exactly what it was told and curtails the rest of the array: measured with a
315 W charge standing, 288 W harvested from strings that made 5054 W six seconds
after the command ended. A forcible discharge is worse — it serves the house
from the battery and leaves the MPPT tracker down entirely, and the missing
production then reads as the deficit that asks for more discharge. So while the
strings carry voltage this driver commands nothing at all and leaves the
inverter to its own regulation, which is the better controller in daylight
anyway. **A Huawei battery is under Omnibattery's control after dark only.**

Idle semantics deserve a note, and they are the opposite of what a register
battery does. ``stop_forcible_charge`` hands control back to the inverter's own
working mode, which resumes self-consumption; a *held* zero would instead be a
forcible charge at 0 W, which the hardware does accept and sustain. That held
zero was the first implementation here and it was wrong twice over: a pinned
battery cannot absorb its own PV, so the inverter derated the array, and the
control layer means something else by idle — manual mode idles once and then
leaves the device alone, which left the battery frozen. ``apply_setpoint(0)``
therefore *releases*, and so does ``standby()``.

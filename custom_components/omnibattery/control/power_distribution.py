"""Multi-battery PD load-sharing for Marstek Venus.

Owns the power-distribution algorithm extracted from ChargeDischargeController:
- Proportional power allocation across selected batteries (capped at per-battery
  limits, with iterative redistribution of excess).
- Minimum-battery selection with SOC ordering, per-step activation thresholds,
  power/SOC hysteresis, and wall-clock split-load holds.
- Deadband hold release (re-select + re-write when a split hold expires).

The split-load wall-clock holds are private to this module. The *active battery*
lists (``_active_charge_batteries`` / ``_active_discharge_batteries``) remain on
the controller because sensor.py, switch.py, and the main control loop read and
mutate them; this module reads/writes them by reference via ``self._controller``.

Per-battery limit and capacity primitives (``_battery_power_limit``,
``_clamp_to_system_capacity``) stay on the controller — they are entangled with
slot ceilings, voltage taper, and system caps — and are queried here as inputs.

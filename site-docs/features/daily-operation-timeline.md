# Daily operation timeline

The Overview tab includes a 24-hour operation timeline with 96 fixed
quarter-hour cells. The forecast also continues to 12:00 on the next local day
(48 additional cells), initially outside the viewport. Cells describe battery
actions; the overlaid curves show solar and household energy in `kWh/15 min`.

## Reading the card

- Closed intervals are observed data. The current interval contains the real
  accumulated value and a projected remainder until the quarter closes.
- Future intervals are an informational projection from the active consumption
  and solar profiles, the current battery state and the already selected
  Dynamic Pricing or Time Slot plan.
- Real-Time Price intentionally has no future calendar. It records only its
  actual activations in the past and current interval.
- Solid curves are measured; dashed curves are forecast. Solar and consumption
  use the left `kWh/15 min` axis; total SOC uses the right `0–100%` axis. The
  tooltip shows the interval's observed or projected SOC and names the learned
  solar shape or active sinusoidal fallback. Observed SOC is retained by the
  daily diary and backfilled from Home Assistant Recorder when the panel opens.

Action colors describe flows, not permissions: green means solar energy that
has charged the battery or is allocated to it by the future plan, purple means
a grid-charge decision, blue means observed or projected battery discharge,
and grey means an explicit `grid_charge_not_needed` decision. A soft yellow
fill indicates a window with available solar surplus in which the battery could
charge, without presenting that opportunity as an effective charge. In the
current quarter, a projected solar charge remains yellow until energy entering
the battery is observed. A cell can contain up to three actions; diagonal
patterns and the accessible text preserve the distinction in light and dark
themes. Actions are combined visually only when they were simultaneous; if the
battery changed direction within the quarter-hour, the action observed for the
longest time is shown. The current interval never presents an action projected
for its remaining minutes as observed. “Charging to setpoint” is context, not
another color. Charge Delay uses
a clock marker and an estimated unlock time. The tooltip also shows the energy
that actually entered or left the battery during an observed interval. For a
future interval it shows the corresponding projected charge or discharge.

## Entity contract

The diagnostic entity is
`sensor.omnibattery_daily_operation_timeline`. Its state is the local snapshot
date. Attributes include `schema_version`, timezone, freshness, profile
sources, 96-value energy series, observed and projected total SOC, operation masks, grid decisions and delay
metadata. The daily series and operation arrays remain 96 values to preserve
the existing contract. The extension is published separately as
`extended_horizon` and `extended_projection`, bounded to 48 intervals and
excluded from Recorder; the entity is safe to use from a dashboard without
causing control reevaluations. Its forecast is produced from detached,
immutable inputs by a side-effect-free simulator. Predictive diagnostics are
owned and restored by the pricing lifecycle, never by rendering this entity.

The backend keeps completed quarter-hours immutable. A plan reevaluation may
replace only the open current interval and the future. Store restoration is
accepted only for the same local date and temporal fingerprint; corrupt data
degrades to an empty timeline and never blocks battery control.

## Mobile and missing data

On narrow screens the 144 cells keep a readable minimum width and scroll
horizontally by hour. The initial view stays on the first 24 hours; press the
right navigation arrow to reveal the additional 12 hours. Keyboard arrows,
touch and mouse tooltips expose the same interval details. Missing telemetry
remains `null`; it is not silently turned into zero. When a forecast is
unavailable or stale, the card keeps the observed past and marks only
unjustified future values as unavailable.
